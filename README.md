# Capture_Address

### Correct an address: Write an algorithm that corrects the fields country, state, city of a postal address. 
    Example: Country: RO, State: New York, City: Iasi will become Country: RO, State: Iasi, City: Iasi. 
### The algorithm needs to have unit tests and integration tests for performance and precision ideally the algorithm will work for all countries in the world and a few languages. 
### Expose a REST api using spring boot that will receive a postal address and return the corrected result. 
### Deploy the application as a docker container in aws/heroku or other using a continuous deployment pipeline.
